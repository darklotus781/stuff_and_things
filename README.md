# Stuff and Things
A Minecraft mod that adds Stuff and Things for NeoForge 1.21.1  

**Layered Blocks**  
Imagine your favorite Minecraft block but it acts like Snow Layers and it can be water logged!  
Glass and Ice like blocks drop with silk touch, ALL Layered blocks drop with a Create Wrench.  
Shift while breaking a layered block and only the top layer will break, without shift, the entire stack will break.  
That's right, Layered Blocks are here, and for 1.21.1 Minecraft.  Missing a block, let us know and we'll add it!    

**Slab Blocks**  
Vanilla Minecraft is missing slab variants of many blocks, so we've introduced our own.  Grass, Dirt, Obsidian, Netherrack and more.  
These work like normal slabs and even blocks like Grass and Dirt can have plants on them even if it's the top slab only!  

**Light Blocks & Glass Light Blocks**  
All 16 colors of Light Blocks and Glass Light Blocks.  
- Light Blocks are crafted from Glow Ink Sacs and Concrete  
- Glass Light Blocks are crafted from Glow Ink Sacs and Stained Glass  

**Grate Blocks**  
Industrial Iron, Iron and Andesite Grate Blocks crafted on the stone cutter  
Grate Blocks can be waterlogged, this allows them to function like Leaf blocks for soil irrigation and more.  

**Iron Plating**  
Like the Industrial Iron Block from Create, but with an Iron Texture (Lighter than Industrial Iron)  

**Netherite Dust** (requires Create)  
Create a Netherite factory by creating Netherite Dust from Obsidian Powder and Cinder flour
